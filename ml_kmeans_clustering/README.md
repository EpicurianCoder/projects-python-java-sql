# This is part of a series of python programs written as excercises.

## This program gives the option to choose from one of the three datasets provided (as well as choosing K itself) and uses k-means grouping in order group the resulting datapoints into relative clusters.

* The DataSet in this case uses the following three two datapoints:
  * *The birth rate of a country*
  * *The average life expectancy in a country*
  * *The name of the country (used for labelling purposes only and data output purposes)*
