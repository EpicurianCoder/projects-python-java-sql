## This belongs to the file **polynomial_regression.py**

# This is part of a series of python programs written as excercises.

## This program takes a dataset and plots this data onto a scatterplot and then, using polynomial regression, plots a predictive curve out outputs all data on a labelled graph.

* The DataSet in this case uses the following three two datapoints:
  * *The number of Oscars Meryl Streep has won*
  * *The number of Golden Globe Nomination Meryl Streep has*
  * *The corresponding year for the data pairs (used for labelling purposes only)*
